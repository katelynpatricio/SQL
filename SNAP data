--This data analyzes SNAP participation across U.S. counties in 2000 and 2010, examining trends in participation, the relationship between population growth and SNAP participation, and the potential impact of water scarcity on SNAP rates.

(There are a couple of ways to do this, one being a multi-join, which we technically dont yet learned, but you can think about how yous really not different than most of our aggregate functions).*/
